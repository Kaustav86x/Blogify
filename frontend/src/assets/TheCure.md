# **The Cure**


**The Introduction**

From our childhood, some of us are not very good at expressing what we feel about something. Be it's a person, human emotion or a mere materialistic aspect. but, there are times in everyone's life, where that individual becomes quiet and an invisible and nearly invincible wall cuts out that human being from the outside world. Social life, love, career, psychological and spiritual beliefs , family - a man's life is tied up with duties he can't possibly run away from even if he wants to and as a man expressing feelings in front of society is no better than swimming under water with a bleeding wound next to a shark. So, with time it is being implicitly fed to us men that no matter what we can't act like falling apart, even though everything has already fallen apart.

**The build-up**

You might be wondering what comes next! I mean talking about men's mental health feels like talking about some ancient historic structure. Sounds so exciting and majestic right ? But no one knows about the war it has witnessed, the burden it's carrying, the secrets it's hiding and for centuries and still it's holding it's ground. The cure to male loneliness is not yet known. There isn't any actual cure for it. The void we've created inside infused with complex human emotions, can't be filled with mere materialistic aspects but one can follow the method of isolation. Isolation is suffering with a smile on your face. Isolating yourself from letting people taking a peek. Either they'll be scared to death by seeing the endless chaos that's going on or they might keep staring at the infinity till they get lost in the void. Either way, you'll be a 'freak' to them! So it's better to keep the beast where it belongs. Though it's not an easy task to hold it, despite of tied to endless chains of fate and miseries, it keeps growling, wants a way out. It can't be tamed but there are certain people in our lives our inner beasts feel free and alive. But I was scared to let it on loose. The joy of suffering in silence entertained me so much that I started considering myself to be a misfit, destined to ruin beautiful things and bring bad omen. I used to isolate myself so much that people used to make me scared. Just the thought of talking to people scared me to the bones. I used to hate happy souls wandering on the streets as my soul was slowly getting engulfed into the darkness. Drinking, smoking weeds, porn, staying up late to watch disturbing contents just to make me feel alive, just an attempt to fill the fraction of that void. No one bothered to ask how I was. It was like I was standing at an illuminated place, looking at the darkness. The darkness was reaching to me faster than the light. My soul used to devour the steam from the hot coffee before my physical self got a chance to take a sip. Eventually, the coffee went cold, so was my soul. I kept going without realizing what's good or bad, I just kept going. But something changed. How it changed, when it changed, well..it was over a woman. She never loved me and I couldn't stopped loving her. Normal. What has changed then ? Well, the "incident" turned me into an observer. A person who is obsessed with someone's psychological profile. I was offering myself an opportunity to change. I started to come out of my cave often to give people a chance of showing if they really want me to be there among them or not and to be honest, it's not that bad. I was just okay with what I am for the first time in my life and some souls around me made me believe the same. It's a time consuming process. Days and months gone by, I kept gambling and taking chances. Don't ask me if I was winning or not ! This time, I didn't keep a track. From a dull and sleepy cubicle, an idea popped up - a trip to the mountains. The moment I was asked, I could see an answer emerging, an answer to a question being asked since time immemorial - "What's cure to male loneliness?", I beamed and whispered - "Maybe this is possibly most accurate answer to that question." and that was probably the first time in my life I said "Okay, I'm in". The countdown began.

**The snap !**

From dusty, old cubicle to snowy mountains brought me back to life!

**The transition**

As I hold a drink and gazed into the city's nocturnal face, the cool breeze whispered, gently - "Live in the moment". Millions of dots were twinkling far on the side of an unnamed mountain as if they are winking and giggling at our lame jokes. As the breeze caressed our faces and stirred our thoughts, our eyes filled with emotion. One recalled the first tender moments of love, another relived their soul's first communion with another, offering the night to the cosmos, while yet another began reworking life's formulas, reflecting on a path that hadn't quite aligned with their dreams. We were cursing ourselves. With the night growing older, some unnamed nocturnal bird flew past our balcony. The dots started to disappear. The nature enveloped us in it's beauty and we sat still, unable to explain the magic of the moment.

**The healing**

The next day, we headed for a homestay on the lap of a tea garden. The best part was, not the snowy mountains or the fog but the greenery. The greenery had us. It was so soothing and relaxing that it melted our hearts and the cherry on top was the food. Darkness surrounded us, early with the feeling of chills. Someone asked, "Does anyone of you believe in ghosts ?" and one of the most controversial discussions of my life was about to get started. Through several so called, "facts" and incidents, some drunk young individuals started to believe that the ghost in fact present with us right now. Out of curiosity, we went to the terrace just to check if we could see something or not. Nothing remarkable wasn't in sight but one of our lighters wasn't lighting. Believe me, at that point if I was fully in my senses, I'd have run. Instead, we didn't utter a single word and went downstairs. The degree of intensity of the conversation made 3 boys sleep in one bed where only 2 of them could barely fit!! When I woke up with a dirty hangover, I was pissed for the headache but I was happy for raising the glasses to one of those silly nights that 7 of us will never forget. Good things don't last long, right? We were on the verge of saying goodbye to the mountains as we headed to the last destination. The dots started to get connected.

**The change**

I never thought I'd become so possessive about a mere village. I don't know what worked out for me but I still want to go back to that place. Those of you are wondering about the last night, yes! We had deep and long conversations, until 2 AM in the freezing cold. I still can't believe I found a place like that where a winding road snaked its way alongside a dense forest, leading up to the mountain's summit. Local houses and homestays dotted the landscape, their windows glowing with dim yellow lights that gently illuminated the twists and turns of the path. As night deepened, the road grew quieter, with vehicles becoming a rare sight. It was a mesmerizing dance of light and shadow, a serene interplay between the encroaching darkness and the sparse, warm lights. The continuous, low-pitched murmur of the wild mountain river, accompanied by the rustling wind, intertwined with a sense of sorrow and despair, washed over us. I could sense the healing energy within myself. I've found the cure!

**The lesson and the commitment**

With the break of dawn, we made our way to the station, fueled by a glimmer of hope that soon, very soon, I would return. It was my journey, destined to find the cure. Drawn to unravel the mystery and magic, I vowed to come back. My soul was ready to be offered to the shadows.
