# **The Beginning**
<br>
When I was on my deathbed, 
mesmerized by the fallen angels coming to my rescue, 
I saw you
You were there looking at the cosmos with your arms wide open, 
accepting the inevitable to come.
I wasn't scared, 
echoes from the trenches were howling, enchanting the dark spell, engulfing my surroundings, but 
I wasn't scared.
I was waiting for the end to take my soul and reunite with you...
