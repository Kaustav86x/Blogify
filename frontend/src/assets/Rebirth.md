# **Rebirth**

Some treasures are better hidden, 
Some dragons are better to be left with the tomb they are guarding
A lone soldier, lost the war,
Came to the tomb
The dragon threatend him.
He was tired.
He offered something to the protector 
Two souls clashed, the lightning fell from the sky, nature witnessed.
The tomb remained guarded for eternity.
