# **The Savior**

Mended soul, empty head
What if I lost and fades, 
away from the first shine that made,
me blush for the very first time,
made me feel my existence !
Down the valleys deep where,
life can be monotonous,
something is carrying me to that darkness.
The light is not seen anymore,
maybe I'm too far gone or maybe I'm dreaming.
I can't seek the answer to the light.
How can I ?
The very light which failed to reach the bottom of my soul. 
The very light, the light that gave up.
The light...that never came !
