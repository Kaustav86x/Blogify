# **--An unnamed piece--**
<br>
<br>
Consider this writing to be the continuation of my second last piece – <strong>‘Invisible’</strong>.
<br>
<br>
This piece does not have a specific name. Though the name depends on the reader. Sometimes, putting a label on top of a collection of sentences does not make it meaningful at all. Sometimes justifying the shared feeling of a group of readers just with the help of a title is not fair and what I am going to share in this piece is possibly cannot be tagged as a specific feeling as well.
<br>
<br>
Request to anyone who will be reading this piece – give it a name.

The reason why I mention this piece to be the continuation of ‘Invisible’ is because even if you pull yourself out of that void and find a so called ‘solution’ to the problem, there is still something to it. I am not aware of the exact term but it is related to the weightage of your achievements. I know, people are going to point it out as ‘relative’ and agreed, it is relative. No matter what you are or who you are if your materialistic aspect does not speak for yourself then you are absolutely nothing. In simple words, you are valued by your number of possessions. What I have seen, it must be physical, living, or non-living. Now, continuing the discussion on this topic might led to controversy as you can never stop ‘comparing’ the number of possessions you have with someone else. It goes on, people by people, possession by possession. Forget about nirvana or meaning of life, just for the sake of being noticed we ‘acquire’. I have not met any individual in the course of my life yet who would explain what does it feel to be noticed. There are people, I feel, go through this spectrum of being ‘noticeable’, knowingly, or unknowingly just because of the possession of something. It varies from person to person or maybe I do have a preconceived idea of being ‘noticed’ mapped to my inner-self so firmly that now I cannot let it go. But when I consume every story, every movement, every experience of the people I know, indirectly, I try to evaluate it with what I feel and then the problem arises, the evaluation stops midway. The scenario is more like trying out everything I could lay my eyes on with the sheer expectation of erasing the feeling of being useless and the cherry on top is, emptiness. Whatever we do to navigate our way through every single day is just somehow a desperate attempt of waging a war on never ending loneliness. Now you would be pissed if I tell you that there is an inner shell to it. A shell representing people who do not have those so-called possessions and still very much walk on that spectrum of being ‘noticeable’ like a king. These people are ruthless and will not think twice before pulling the trigger no matter who you are. ‘Be yourself’ is not enough. It is an idea fed to the people just to ‘protect’ them and it is eventually destroying them.
<br>
<br>
“Protection from what exactly?
<br>
<br>
“Protection from the change. The values this world live by, the standards the society had set, as a human being if you have none to offer, you are nothing.”
<br>
<br>
“Sounds very complex. What about the destruction?”
<br>
<br>
“Well, it is simpler. If you do not change, you perish. If your inner-self is thirsty for a few claps and a frequent applaud of ‘you are a really nice human being’, then it is dragging you down.”
<br>
<br>
For me, it did not work. I changed a very few habits in my daily life. Tried to put an end to this ‘be yourself’ nonsense and I realised that you can manipulate your actions to create a newer, more powerful version of yourself. Sounds easy but by the time you start seeing the results, it has already impacted your psychological behaviour and believe me, it feels great. Putting a barrier around yourself so that you can reshape that inner ‘you’ in thousand other aspects, is probably the safest gamble out there. The problem is the barrier; it would not last. You must rebuild it. Most of us can’t. There starts the never-ending cycle.

I do not have a shinning feather on the cap of my achievements, yet. In fact, I have no feather. With the addition of every feather to my cap, my mind will grow more complex. Maybe there will be a day, when my possessions will make me feel seen and I will manage to take a long walk on that spectrum.
