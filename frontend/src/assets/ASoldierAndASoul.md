# **A Soldier and a Soul**

You are as chill as the cold mountain breeze yet 
When I tried to see inside it was set ablaze
A narrow aperture yet I could see scars on it
A shadow embraced by the darkness, numb lying there
I tried to pick it up with bare hands
It deserves a honourable burial 
like a fallen warrior
"My graveyard, it's full of warriors, let me bury you among them"- I said to the soul
The soul whispered , "I belong to the shallows".....
I couldn't see it anymore...
I looked at my hand, it was full of scars...
